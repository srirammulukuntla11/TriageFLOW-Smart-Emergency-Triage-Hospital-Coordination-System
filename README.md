🏥 TriageFLOW – Smart Emergency Triage & Hospital Coordination System

TriageFLOW is a smart, web-based emergency triage system designed to assist ambulance crews and hospitals in making faster, data-driven decisions during medical emergencies.

The system evaluates patient vital signs, determines priority levels, and recommends suitable hospitals while providing hospitals with a real-time dashboard to monitor incoming patients.
